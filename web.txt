How does the internet work?

The internet is a network that connects myriad computers and servers to each other in various ways - hard lines / wifi etc.
There are many smaller networks that together combine to make the internet as a whole (ISP's, local networks etc.)
Smaller computers and personal devices (clients) connect to these smaller networks (ISP's) and gain access to the overall internet and servers through these ISP's.
Every machine connected to the internet has a unique identity in the form of a IP address (numerical identification). 
Clients send requests to various servers via ISP, and in turn receive various media as a result.. messages, videos, files etc.
These files are broken up into smaller pieces called 'packets' for easier distribution between machines and are put back together by specific programs on said machine.  


What happens when you click a link?
When you click a link, the browser you are using identifies the IP address for the hostname/domain name and any other specifics, such as resources(specific pages) etc.

The browser sends a http request to a server

The server sends back an http response and begins fulfilling your request (depending upon what you clicked)

First the browser will render HTML and then load other embedded objects/languages (javascript functionality or pictures/videos etc).
